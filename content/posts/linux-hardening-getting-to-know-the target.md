My main personal machine since 2015 is an [Inspiron 15 Dell](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-15-laptop/spd/inspiron-15-3520-laptop) laptop. Despite being my primary workstation, I never bothered hardening it. The system rarely kept the same operating system for more than a few months, and I treated it as disposable.

This changes today.
