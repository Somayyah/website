If you're someone who uses the keyboard alot you probably ran into RSI, the sharp pending pain every few strokes or once a while. I'm not buying a new ergonomic keyboard yet because what if it didn't work for me? also I hate how many modern solutions require buying a gadget or some specialized tool. Instead I will try to solve the issue by myself, DIY style.<br><br>

1 - Keyboard type : I found that a wide set keybaord is more forgiving than the laptop's built in keyboard. This is because my dominant wrist isn't as telted inwards. Of course a split keyboard is an even better option but I may consider it for the future.<br>
2 - I found that by adjusting the screen to be a tiny bit higher than my eye level, my neck position and back are more relaxed and straight. For that I just placed my laptop on top of a small portable table, I don't know it's name but the point is I just used whatever.<br>
3 - Taping my pinky also helped, this way I don't use it when typing and the pain is minimized.<br>
4 - Movement every 45 minutes also helped.<br><br>

So far I see some progress, I will keep on refining my approach until I no longer have pain to manage.
