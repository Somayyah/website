I decided to start learning WiFi cybersecurity. I already work with enterprise wireless networks, my expertise lies in protocols like **RADIUS**, **TACACS+**, **802.1X**, **MAB**, EAP in all its flavors, guest networks ... etc. I’d say I have a good grip on managing WLCs, creating access points, configuring them top to bottom.<br><br>

But I want the **rogue** kind of expertise.<br><br>

I want to learn the unforgiving, chaotic, messy consumer-side WiFi. When someone asks why the signal is better in the kitchen than in the bedroom, I want to have a real answer not just “because the router’s closer.”<br><br>

So I started researching adapters. I knew I’d need one that supports **monitor mode** and **packet injection**. These are non negotiable if you’re serious about learning WiFi hacking. Otherwise the adapter’s just a piece of plastic.

### First stop: TP-Link TL-WN722N v1

This one’s the cheapest decent option but only if you get version 1, as the newer ones are useless. No monitor mode and wrong chipset, completely useless for our purposes. Sadly it’s a collector’s item now, stores haven’t stocked it in ages and the packaging makes it worse, you think you’re buying v1, but then you flip the box and see version 3.2 hiding on the back like it’s ashamed of itself.

Amazon seemed to have it. I found this [listing](https://www.amazon.com/Tp-Link-TL-WN722N-IEEE-802-11n-draft/dp/B002SZEOLG/) that looked right. But after digging through the reviews I realized it’s actually version 2.

I don’t get why TP-Link can’t just say the version clearly in the listing. Why can't I buy a simple piece of hardware without gambling?

### Then I looked at the Alfa AWUS036ACH

This one’s a beast. More expensive, more powerful, dual antennas, people swear by it for pentesting. I was hyped. Until I realized something weird: no stores in my country carry it. I called around and eventually learned why, Alfa adapters are banned!! Just banned outright, for reasons I still don’t fully understand.

### The Panda PAU09 N600

That’s the [one](https://www.amazon.com/Panda-Wireless-PAU09-Adapter-Antennas/dp/B01LY35HGO/), Dual-band, supports monitor mode and packet injection, uses the Ralink RT5572 chipset (which Linux loves), and it actually ships to my country.

I already paid 50% upfront and it should arrive in about four weeks. Fingers crossed. I’ll post an update if it ends up being trash or gets confiscated at the border but so far, it looks like a solid contender.

Let’s see.
