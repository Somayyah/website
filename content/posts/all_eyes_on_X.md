There exists an **X**, a destination, a mystery, a possibility. It may be treasure or it may be nothing. The point is not what it is, the point is going there. You do not chase **X** for guarantees. You chase it to **find out**.
<br><br>
It doesn’t have to make sense to anyone else. If it stirs your blood, that’s enough. Maybe you want to become an athlete, a chess grandmaster, an artist... The point is, there’s something there… or maybe not. But you have to find out.
<br><br>
I'm not looking to become a successful version of myself, but the version that walks the path anyway, without certainty, without pretending.

### **Failure Is a Destination, Too**
<br>
Not a shame, but an endpoint, a truth, a crown you *earn* by trying. We do not fear it; we revere it. Not trying puts you beneath failure, at least to fail, you have to earn it.

### **Effort Is Sacred**
<br>
What matters is that you moved and reached the end. were you victorious? defeated? humbled? Maybe. But at least you *dared* to ask "What if?" and didn’t settle for dreaming the answer.

### **Honor is in the Attempt**
<br>
In the scars, in the story and in saying: I failed, and I’m proud. Because I went.
<br><br>

There may be a treasure behind **X**, or maybe it's just a scribble by a kid with crayons and infinite free time. But I chose to keep my eyes on it. I chose to suffer, to walk the walk no matter the result.
<br><br>
I don't chase success.  
I chase the end.  
And if it means I'll fail, then so be it.
