DALL-E 3, developed by OpenAI, is a groundbreaking AI system capable of generating realistic images and art from natural language descriptions. In my latest video, I experimented with the same DALL-E 3 prompts featured in a recent blog post to evaluate its integration with ChatGPT.

## Accessing DALL-E 3 in ChatGPT
To use DALL-E 3 within ChatGPT, you need to subscribe to **ChatGPT Plus**, which is priced at $20/month. Subscribers gain access to several advanced features:

### GPT-4: The Next Evolution
GPT-4, the successor to GPT-3.5, is described by OpenAI as:

- "A large multimodal model, currently accepting text inputs and emitting text outputs, with planned support for image inputs in the future."

### Key Differences Between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5
- **Creativity**: GPT-4 exhibits enhanced creativity compared to GPT-3.5.
- **Visual Input**: GPT-4 introduces the capability for visual input.
- **Context Length**: It can process longer contexts.
- **Reasoning**: Advanced reasoning capabilities are a hallmark of GPT-4.
- **Accuracy**: It is more accurate than its predecessor.
- **Cost**: Operating GPT-3.5 is significantly cheaper than GPT-4.
- **Training Data**: GPT-4 was trained with 45 GB more data than GPT-3.5.
- **Precision**: GPT-4 produces more precise results.
- **Visual Data Interpretation**: Improved interpretation of visual information.

> **Note**: The message cap for GPT-4 users is now 50 messages every three hours, increased from the previous limit of 25!

### Browsing with Bing
ChatGPT Plus includes integration with Microsoft Bing, providing users the ability to access recent information, which is crucial given ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff in January 2022. This feature allows users to browse various websites and receive concise summaries with credible references.

## Upcoming Content
Stay tuned for upcoming videos where we'll delve deeper into these features. Don't forget to subscribe for more updates!
