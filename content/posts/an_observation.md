I find it strange how different my life is as a female engineer here compared to the US. I come from a conservative country. Gender roles are tight, but somehow, engineering never felt like a boy’s club to us. Sure, there are bad apples and skeptics everywhere, but I never had to perform or prove myself. My knowledge always spoke louder than any bias.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the US or at least online the female engineer / programmer narrative feels like it’s always on replay. Women share their stories and the same chorus follows: performance, “DEI hires,” quota filler. It’s not the women I find strange, it’s that their existence is framed as political like their careers need context. Every few months, a company posts a photo of their female staff to announce their inclusivity milestone.
<br><br>
It’s wild considering women were literally some of the first programmers. No hashtags, no photo ops. Just doing the work.

**Not sure what that says, honestly.**
