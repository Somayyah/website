As a Linux user, you’ve probably come across dotfiles. They're named for the dot at the beginning, and add configuration and functionality to many programs, including BASH. The concept is simple, but there are nuances and quirks that are easy to miss. Let’s fix that. In this post, I’ll explain the different types of dotfiles, what belongs where, and how to keep them organized.

**This post isn’t about dotfile managers, maybe in a future post.**

### What even is a Shell?
