Looks like my Fedora VM keeps crashing, I've created it multiple times and each time after running successfully for few hours and everything is fine until it crashes down again.

I'm gonna try to create another machine and perhaps with another destro, but I'll keep on troubleshooting the issue for the Fedora VM in the background and hopefully get answers..

**UPDATE** I decided to partways with Fedora as the LFS host, for now I will test Ubuntu, and I'll try to troubleshoot Fedora VM later, who knows what we would learn?
