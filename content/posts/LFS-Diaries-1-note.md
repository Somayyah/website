Looks like my Fedora VM keeps crashing, I've created it multiple times and each time after running successfully for few hours and everything is fine until it crashes down again.

I'm gonna try to create another machine and perhaps with another destro, but I'll keep on troubleshooting the issue for the Fedora VM in the background and hopefully get answers..
