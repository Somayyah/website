After a long time of focusing on C and assembly, I went back to my LFS project and I don't recall it being such a mess!! The environment variables are mixed up with the default variables for example $HOME and $LFS_HOME ARE THE SAME SOMEHOW!!! And some packages are even compiled in the main system! 

<br>

Like it's not about being comfortable with linux which I already am, instead **washes LFS in a washing machine** I've gotta wash LFS! **sits with LFS at a dining table** I've gotta date LFS! **expands herself so that she's the same size as LFS** I've gotta be LFS! I've got it! **returns to normal size** I have seen the sculpture within!

<br>

Such demoralizing experience but I won't give up. I'll rebuild it and no shortcuts only sweat and tears.
