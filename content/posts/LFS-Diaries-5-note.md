After a long time of focusing on C and assembly, I went back to my LFS project and I don't recall it being such a mess!! The environment variables are mixed up with the default variables for exmaple $HOME and $LFS_HOME ARE THE SAME SOMEHOW!!! And some packages are even compiled in the main system! 


Like it's not about being comfortable with linux which I already am, instead [washes LFS in a washing machine] I've gotta wash LFS! [sits with LFS at a dining table] I've gotta date LFS! [expands herself so that she's the same size as LFS] I've gotta be LFS! I've got it! [returns to normal size] I have seen the sculpture within!


Such demoralizing experience but I won't give up. I'll rebuild it and no shortcuts only sweat and tears.
