But a curious tween cursed with adults who mistook your interests for assets, and exploited you for their own gain and ego. 
<br><br>
The potential was never there and the burnout is just you finally being humbled by your own limits.
You were a unicorn startup, investors placed early bets and once the hype fizzled out, they vanished. Enjoy the ROI if any, grief the lost time, move on and take off the "burned out gifted kid" label like it's some tragic badge of honor, you're not a hero just for enduring.
<br><br>
You were never a prodigy or special, and that's ok.
