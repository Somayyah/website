We have two budgets, money and time, and to save money we gotta spend time, for example to save money on transportation we have to walk more or use public transportation, basically to save money we gotta sacrifice conveniences.

The issue is that we prioritize convenience which makes us waste money to "save" time, but I argue that time isn't spent well and instead we are letting it spell, it's moving anyways so I say we try to spend it intentionally as saving it is meaningless.

Money on the otherhand is finite and we don't have unlimited amount of it anyways so I say budgetting it over money is wiser.

Of course there are nuances to everything, and I’m not advocating for living life on hard mode. I just want us to be more aware of how, little by little, we’re engaging less with experiences and becoming more like observers rather than active participants.
