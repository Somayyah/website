There’s no such thing as “ugly people.” There are just people who perform up to society’s beauty standards and people who don’t. And honestly? Both are valid. You can choose to perform—be skinny, be muscular, contour your face into a whole new dimension, whatever. Or you can just *exist* as you are, and that’s okay too.  

Some people get a genetic head start, sure, but the rest of us? We’re out here putting in the *work* to perform. And that’s why I don’t judge people who “buy” their way into the performance—plastic surgery, fillers, whatever. If the game is rigged and you weren’t handed a “perfect” mask at birth, why not craft one yourself? It’s all fake anyway.  

And that’s also why I don’t care if someone calls me ugly. It just means I'm not performing up to *their* standards. But what if I'm not performing in the first place?
