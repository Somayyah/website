      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled a list of articles I use for my re-reading exercise—articles intentionally difficult to read, often filled with jargon, HR-related topics, and dense regulations. The goal is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://techwebunraveled.xyz/posts/snap-out-of-it-how-i-m-learning-to-thrive-in-boredom-instead-of-scratching-it-away/#more-reps&#34;&gt;build focus and patience by revisiting these challenging reads&lt;/a&gt;. I recommend using the reader mode whenever possible, the below list is continuously updated:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 - &lt;a href=&#34;https://mindofhr.com/2023/12/revolutionizing-human-resources-with-scrum-a-comprehensive-exploration/&#34;&gt;https://mindofhr.com/2023/12/revolutionizing-human-resources-with-scrum-a-comprehensive-exploration/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pit&#34;&gt;The Pit&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Books unread, movies unwatched, and abandoned projects—why? When did I become so easily distracted? When did enjoyable activities and hobbies become a chore? And when did we become pawns, so easily influenced and signed over our attention and focus, letting corporations make money off it for free?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attention is a highly valued asset, so no wonder the marketing industry is valued at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.statista.com/markets/479/topic/680/marketing/#:~:text=Marketing%20services%20are%20a%20billion-dollar%20industry%2C%20showing%20positive,segment%20growing%20exceptionally%20well%20is%2C%20unsurprisingly%2C%20digital%20marketing.&#34;&gt;$481 billion&lt;/a&gt;. From influencers sharing referral links for lip gloss in shades identical to countless others, to politicians dividing people with inflammatory comments, and then there’s a cute kitten hopping into a box—all within a minute of scrolling through Instagram. It’s no surprise we feel our attention slipping away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
