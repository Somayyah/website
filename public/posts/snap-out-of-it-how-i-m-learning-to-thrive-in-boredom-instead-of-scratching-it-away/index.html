            <h2 id="the-pit">The Pit</h2>
<p>Books unread, movies unwatched, and abandoned projects—why? When did I become so easily distracted? When did enjoyable activities and hobbies become a chore? And when did we become pawns, so easily influenced and signed over our attention and focus, letting corporations make money off it for free?</p>
<p>Attention is a highly valued asset, so no wonder the marketing industry is valued at <a href="https://www.statista.com/markets/479/topic/680/marketing/#:~:text=Marketing%20services%20are%20a%20billion-dollar%20industry%2C%20showing%20positive,segment%20growing%20exceptionally%20well%20is%2C%20unsurprisingly%2C%20digital%20marketing.">$481 billion</a>. From influencers sharing referral links for lip gloss in shades identical to countless others, to politicians dividing people with inflammatory comments, and then there’s a cute kitten hopping into a box—all within a minute of scrolling through Instagram. It’s no surprise we feel our attention slipping away.</p>
<h2 id="red-inflammed-teary-eyes">Red Inflammed Teary Eyes</h2>
<p>I vividly remember watching hours of Youtube movie theories and documentaries as a distraction from studying, or finishing Anime marathons as an escape from the mundane life. I bragged about finishing a 500 pages novel in 3 days and flexed my knowledge with random esoteric trivia.</p>
<p>Now I long for my fulfilling &ldquo;distractions&rdquo;, as I’m unable to engage with content longer than 15 seconds. As days slip through my fingers, I feel defeated by the sight of piles of abandoned projects and dusty books. My brain feels dulled, fermenting in a dopamine haze as I doom scroll with red, inflamed, teary eyes.</p>
<h2 id="what-box">What box?!</h2>
<p>A strength—or maybe a weakness—of mine is that I&rsquo;m not bound to any limitations. I acknowledge the walls, but who&rsquo;s to say that I can&rsquo;t jump over them? For example, I’m not gifted, and I’m aware of it, but if one day I decide to become a mathematician or a chess grandmaster, I’ll pursue it with everything I have.</p>
<p>But you’re old! You should have started young… bla bla bla, I KNOW!!</p>
<p>I couldn’t care less; I have no limiting beliefs, at least when it comes to my cognitive abilities. So why should becoming a focused, patient, and productive person be any different? No matter what, there must be&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="a-way-out">A Way Out</h2>
<p>I’ve pursued self-improvement for ages, struggling to maintain a productivity streak even in the things I enjoy. I’ve tried planners, the Pomodoro technique, self-help books (which I never finish), limiting my screen time, supplements… you name it, but with no luck. Understanding my struggles has definitely helped me get more done through some tweaks, but these methods aren’t guides for life—they don’t teach us what to prioritize, who is to say that they won&rsquo;t make me productive in wasting my own time which did happen by the way? I&rsquo;m not anti-self improvement just like I&rsquo;m not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuue-s8qM8w">anti-floaties</a>, they are useful in not making me drawn but I also want to swim to the other side. 🥺</p>
<p>Eventually, I had to look for other strategies, which uncovered a flaw that had successfully hidden itself from me. I had always viewed boredom as a negative entity—an unwelcome guest we urgently need to usher out, akin to despair. However, after taking the time to listen to this misunderstood companion, I now recognize it as a valuable tool for mindfulness and even productivity.</p>
<h2 id="me-my-thoughts-and-i">Me, My Thoughts and I</h2>
<p>For whatever reason, our minds struggle to settle into their own thoughts. Without external stimuli, it becomes challenging to stay focused on repetitive tasks, and even harder to do nothing at all. The easy fix? Instant gratification, which has never been more accessible thanks to social media and the rise of short-form content. Our brains are wired to seek immediate rewards, making it all too easy to reach for our phones instead of facing the discomfort of boredom.</p>
<p>But what if we intentionally deprive ourselves of this instant fix? What if we wean our minds off dopamine and train them to embrace boredom instead? What if we committed to periods of silence, spending hours without smartphones—just ourselves and our thoughts?</p>
<p>Why would I do this? Because finding contentment in solitude is crucial for starting or finishing anything meaningful. How can you read a book if your mind wanders at every turn? How can you code for hours if you can’t remain still without seeking more stimulating activities? Learning to sit with discomfort opens the door to deeper focus and creativity.</p>
<p>For that I&rsquo;m set to free my mind of this curse by training my mind, with a regimen I will be detailing below.</p>
<h2 id="letting-go">Letting go</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s with a heavy heart I decided to part ways with music, effective immediately. What used to be an introspective experience has become just a quick fix. I’ve always had an appreciation for long music by artists like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4csDpJtsBLw">Majda Al-Romi</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wBvuZVE7FI">Um-Kalthum</a>, as well as bands like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OC2aPCuzjo">Electric Guest</a>. I loved the narratives, the storylines, and the immersive experiences they provided; they were once my escape. But now, sitting through even a minute of a song feels like an accomplishment, not to mention how distracting it has become.</p>
<p>I’m reclaiming my love for music. I will no longer treat it like fast food—an empty-calorie meal just to satisfy a craving. I want to reclaim the rituals, the atmosphere, and the racing feelings. Rather than using it to fill time; I want to make time to truly listen to it, you know?</p>
<h2 id="words-worth-a-thousand-pictures">Words Worth a Thousand Pictures</h2>
<p>To further this commitment, I&rsquo;ll limit video consumption, regardless of whether it’s short or long. Even when searching for a tutorial, I’ll seek out written versions instead. The goal is to improve comprehension and challenge my instinct to skim over topics; this should help me regain my love for reading. I need to learn to sit through hours of research and do my homework before I ask a question, and thus I must challenge the instinct to take the path of least resistance.</p>
<h2 id="more-reps">More Reps!</h2>
<p>Re-reading anything can become tedious and boring quickly, which means that it&rsquo;s a good exercise in my quest to tame boredom. By selecting the most boring, stupid, and jargon-filled articles, and reading them multiple times until exhaustion while trying to comprehend them, you train your mind to no longer consider enjoyment as a deciding factor in finishing a task.</p>
<p>I suggest starting starting with one page articles and 5 reads * 3 reps, below is a list of boring HR Scrum and Agile mumbo jumbo-related keywords that are guaranteed to make your brain scream in agony and beg for the sweet release of death:</p>
<ol>

<li>Impact of Agile Coaching on Employee Performance and Organizational Culture</li>
<li>Agile Workforce Planning: Aligning Sprint Goals with Talent Strategy</li>

</ol>
<p>Did you notice the repeated title? If yes then&hellip; what are you doing here? 🙁</p>
<h2 id="tudum-cue-netflix-intro">Tudum! (Cue Netflix Intro)</h2>
<p>I compiled an Excel sheet of 944 movies that I need to finish, aiming for at least one movie per week. A once-loved activity shouldn&rsquo;t feel like a chore but rather something to look forward to and prepare for.</p>
<h2 id="cursive">Cursive?</h2>
<p>Handwriting is a challenging task, especially when you&rsquo;re not just copying text. It’s a valuable discipline exercise, and committing to writing at least one page of original content each week is a solid start. It’s important to write as neatly as possible; the goal is to be mindful of your font, colors, and overall presentation. Take all the time you need to finish your masterpiece.</p>
<p>Boredom is like untapped wealth—a vast reserve of time waiting to be invested. Imagine complaining about having too much money! How bizarre it would be if ancient humans had tried to escape boredom with instant gratification; we&rsquo;d have ended up with a half-assed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra">Petra</a> or a headless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sphinx_of_Giza">Sphinx of Giza</a>.</p>
<p>These enduring monuments stand as testaments to discipline, patience, and the ability to sit through discomfort. They were built over years—decades, even—because the builders understood that great achievements don’t come from quick fixes. If a monk can survive on berries and seeds, meditating alone in the mountains of Tibet, surely you can make it through Scrum-Driven Conflict Resolution Strategies for HR Teams.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same principle. Sitting with discomfort—whether in silence or in boredom—is where meaningful work begins. Just as those guys didn&rsquo;t have the option to scroll through Instagram, we too need to embrace the discomfort of stillness and focus to create something truly valuable. If we can learn to endure boredom, we unlock the potential to accomplish great things—just like those who came before us.</p>
